# Telemedicine-Cloud-Validation
This repository is part of a validation of cybersecurity requirements
within the master thesis with the topic "Requirements on Secure Cloud Design
for Telemedicine Applications" by Sebastian Steinm√ºller.

The code described here implements a basic tele-emergency-doctor
application that could allow emergency services to remotely get in
contact with a doctor via a video call. Additionally the emergency
doctor, who is at a remote location compared to the incident site, will
be able to view vital parameters of the patient and would be able to
provide helpful information and diagnosis for the staff that is on site. 

The implementation follows the requirements that have been defined in
the thesis. With this project, most of the defined requirements will be
tested for practicality and implementability.

## Installation
The final application can be accessed at //TODO add URL

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
As this is part of a final thesis for a masters degree, contribution is
not possible. But feel free to fork or read more about the topic in the
thesis. //TODO Link  

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
